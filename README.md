# Hello World, I'm Mauricio.ðŸ‘‹

In the early 2000s, I took my first steps into the world of the web by creating a website that showcased the local bands in the coastal scene of Sao Paulo. Skip ahead to today, and I'm having a lot of fun building some seriously awesome content for the web.

My current focus revolves around crafting value for Capgemini's clients through the realm of web development. The journey with Capgemini has led me to exciting collaborations on significant projects. As a coding enthusiast, I'm all in when it comes to tackling challenges on both the front and back ends. Lately, I've been diving into the world of Next.js, an interesting amagalm of React and Node.js that's a paradise for a full stack dev.

However, life isn't solely about code and pixels! When I'm not engrossed in the digital realm, I'm enjoying quality time with my partner and our doggy duo. You'll also find me calculating my next move in board games, or conjuring arcane spells in tabletop RPGs.

So, if any of these things interests you, feel free to reach out.
